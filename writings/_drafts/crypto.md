When I encountered the term “sneakerbot” in a gaming-related chatroom earlier this year, I had to look up what it meant.

A few short minutes of reading about this filled me with plenty of mixed feelings. Sneakerbots are programs that automate online shopping for limited-edition physical goods, such as rare sneakers. Typically, people who run sneakerbots do so with the goal of reselling those goods at a premium, profiting from a price hike which was only possible in the first place because an already scarce supply was made even scarcer by bots. Anyone with basic technical expertise can run a sneakerbot, with some even being readily available as open source software on GitHub. Online discourse about the legal status of sneakerbots often misses one crucial question: _is it moral_?

Somehow, discovering the concept of sneakerbots has my hairs standing on end the same way when I witness the unyielding proliferation of cryptocurrency and NFTs within tech and other online spaces, not because they are in any way related, but because I sense that there are similar mentalities at play that drive their rapid technological innovation: all of them operate in mostly unregulated spaces and ultimately capitalize on our fears.

“NFTs are valuable because they are rare,” I remember reading when I was first trying to understand why would someone sink hundreds or even thousands for owning what is otherwise an infinitely reproducible JPEG. Not all rare things are considered valuable, though. My cat's cheek whiskers are _extremely rare_—there are only 24 of them in the whole world—but if I minted the ownership of a single whisker as individual tokens and tried to put them up for auction, I doubt that they would fetch much. That's because there is no larger story attached to my cat—he's just a cat—and there is currently no social status to be gained by virtually “collecting” one of his whiskers either.

Nike shoes, on the other hand, are mass-produced and thus not rare at all, but if you spin a compelling enough story around a certain set, it's that story that people will be buying, not the materials nor labor involved. For example, a black and red Nike with a drop of human blood in it—a substance that at an any given time you have around five liters of in your body—can [fetch USD1,018 if there are only 666 pairs ever made][satan] and if owning one displays affiliation with a meme lord pop star.

NFTs are the perfect amalgamation of two concepts that should be contradicting each other: mass production and rarity. After all, generating an NFT set is easy enough that [even a 12 year old can do it][whales] by forking [a bit of unsophisticated code][bananas] that glues different sprites together. I believe that the world of NFTs has organically perfected the same marketing strategies as as those of todays leading fashion brands and of the De Beers company of the early 20th century: taking an extremely common object, like shoes or diamonds, and artificially elevating it to something wildly precious.

What is the story, then, that you buy into when collecting an NFT? It depends on the token, but one common promise is that by participating, you are supporting an emerging standard that is supposed to solve the problem of digital artists not being fairly compensated for their work. With picrew-style NFT avatars that are part of a set, purchasing one can also gain you access to an exclusive club. NFTs are also seen as an investment opportunity that no financially-savvy person should miss. But the larger promise is that by getting involved with crypto at this early stage, you are among _visionaries_ who are shaping the future of economy, art, the Web, and ultimately of democracy as a whole.

There is something implicitly marketed to those who purchase crypto, but it's not a kind of token on a blockchain. Instead, I think Matthew Remski might have been on to something when he tried to decode what is [the actual product of the billion-dollar Western yoga industry][yoga]:

> When will it come? What will it feel like? How will we know it’s here?
> No one can say.
> The aspirational self — if it comes into existence at all — does not follow supply-chain logic. It cannot be traced back to a resource, a process of extraction, a result of exploited labour.
> The aspirational self is ephemeral, but it is nonetheless commodified and marketed.

The aspirational self within crypto communities is a GMI (“gonna make it”) type of personality who believes that purchasing a digital token earns them the rank of a pioneer in a brave digital future and that, as a reward, they deserve to hear bland uplifting statements like “gm” (good morning) in a chat room every day. Much like a yoga teacher telling you in her soothing voice to thank yourself for being at this session today, your buying choices are being framed as stepping towards a higher self and thus (magically) towards a better world.

As any leftist on Twitter, I'm contractually obligated to poke fun at crypto-libertarians and NFT-obsessed collectors because in my mind I imagine they are all [this guy with a $600 beanie and a fucked up beard][beard] flexing to his presumably lower-class haters with a question: <q>Where am I, and where are you?</q>  There is probably much that I'm missing—likely because I only ever hear about the obscene outliers in the NFT space, such as pixelated JPEGs that sell for hundreds of thousands—and I really hope that genuine innovation in the world of digital art proves me wrong and that my friends who are artists can finally start earning compensation that they deserve. It's just that right now, as a technology, I don't see NFTs directly addressing the concrete problems that artists have, but Theadora Walsh offers some [hope of how NTFs could be better][artnews]:

> NFTs may be characterized by the brutal aesthetics of “very online” nihilism and Winklevoss venture capitalism, but they don’t have to be.

It's frankly a shame that I have so much prejudice for people who seem genuinely excited about an emerging technology with a lot of fascinating aspects to it. Distributed systems, decentralized ledger of cryptographically verifiable transactions, tamper-proof smart contracts— these are all compelling ideas. However, their practical applications fall short. Ever since the first Bitcoin whitepaper we've been hearing grandiose statements about how blockchain is going to change everything, but all it had concretely produced in over a decade since then is a system of "currencies" that aren't usable as actual currency, a computationally inefficient and environmentally irresponsible transaction verification mechanism, and an online equivalent of a [cruise ship art auction][cruise] that offers a bleak insight into extremely cringe visual aesthetics of those who equate ownership with social status.

To warn friends away from crypto, I've been calling it a pyramid scheme, which in retrospect isn't accurate. Here is Stacie Bosley with [ways to spot a pyramid scheme][pyramid]:

> Time pressure is one red flag. Be wary of directives to "act now or miss a once in a lifetime opportunity". Promises of large, life-altering amounts of income are also suspect. And finally, a legitimate multi-level marketing business shouldn't require members to pay for the opportunity to sell a product or service.

Even though crypto did historically earn huge rewards to early investors, with the money exclusively coming from later investors, it isn't a Ponzi nor a pyramid scheme because there is no single "top" of the structure towards which the money flows and because none of the pillars of what defines a pyramid scheme are a hard requirement in crypto. Sure, in practice all of the same red flags are there—time pressure, pay-to-enter, vague promises of life-altering income—but because of its decentralized nature, even though it walks like a pyramid scheme and quacks like a pyramid scheme, the most genius heist of the 21st century can't be considered a  scam purely on a technicality.

A more just financial system is absolutely needed in today's world, but just making it decentralized doesn't immediately solve all the old problems. In my view, a just financial system should never reward those who already have money with ways to easily earn even more money. A common narrative in cryptocurrency involves promises of redistributing the world's wealth. In the same manifesto where he infamously outed himself as a shit leader, Coinbase CEO declared <q>we want to use cryptocurrency to bring economic freedom to people all over the world.</q> So far he did manage to distribute at least part of the world's wealth, but [mostly to himself][wealth]. Just this year we've seen two promises of a “fairly” distributed currency: one requires you to [put up a publicly-viewable video of yourself][proof] holding a piece of paper while speaking to the camera, and the other [wants you to gaze into an orb][worldcoin] so the orb can read and store your biometric signature. Take your pick between these hopeless, non-inclusive, and socially utterly irresponsible initiatives.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crypto culture seems founded on the idea that decentralizing a shitty system will produce an Innately More Just version of that system - which is simply not true.

I don't know how we will get from late capitalism to a system of fairly distributed wealth to everyone in the world, but I can't imagine that an all-male group of recent college graduates are going to take us there with nothing but a flashy slide deck and venture capital in their pockets. It's dangerous that anyone is even _considering_ that possibility as potentially viable. [Alice Bucknell warns][flashart]:

> Crypto has never reconciled its socialist blockchain fantasies with its current application as yet another avenue for speculative finance. Crypto advocates need to work through that paradox if the new system is to avoid perpetrating old exploitative operations.

In the Philipines, some players of the popular NFT game Axie Infinity are [reported to earn a substantial income][axie], allowing them to recover from the hard toll that the pandemic had on the country. This might sound like the blockchain is helping redistribute the world's wealth, until you understand that Axie players in the Philippines are largely helped by Yield Guild Games who provide “scholarships” by renting players in-game tokens to play with. Basically, a landlord owns the very asset that you depend on for your income. Coupled by the fact that both Axie Infinity and Yield Guild Games have [taken in millions in venture capital][axievc], rest assured that however much a Philippino players earn, the same power structures of the old world will earn orders of magnitude more.

In a brilliant, tone-perfect rant subtitled [<q>Cryptocurrencies and NFTs are an absolute disaster for so many more reasons than the ecological</q>][everest], Everest Pipkin points out how the whole stack is fundamentally flawed:

> I’m sure you’re seeing the problem here- there is not a schema that doesn’t reward those who already are already [sic] wealthy, who are already bought in, who already have excess capital or access to outsized computational power. **Almost universally they grant power to the already powerful.**

Now, we've all heard comparisons of today's cryptocurrency craze with 17th-century tulip mania and for that reason I've been holding my breath for the Bitcoin bubble to burst for some years now, as I'm sure many others did too. But I gave up believing that it will happen anytime soon, at least not in a way that it will magically erase the collective delusion. The price of tulips did crash at a certain point as buyers realized that maybe [a single bulb of a virus-affected flower shouldn't cost $2,500][tulip] in 2013 USD, but the Netherlands is still known for its tulip export which continues to be a massive business. I know first-hand because almost 400 years after the tulip bubble burst, I'm sitting in a house that's in the middle of what's known as De Bollenstreek, a long stretch through North and South Holland known for picturesque expanses of flower fields where various bulbs including the tulip are cultivated. The tulip isn't even native to Western Europe, but hey— they sell well and profit is profit.

Like the tulip, I think crypto is here to stay now—in whatever shape or form—and that the rest of us will have to figure out how to share social spaces with a bunch of laser-eyed blockheads. I've had non-techie friends proudly show me apps on their phones where they track little candlestick charts of various currencies going up or down. They seem genuinely excited about being involved in something larger, especially because that involvement offers vague potential of earning extra income at a time when everyone's basically broke, and others around them seem to share in their excitement too. They rarely ask me, an actual tech person, of what I think about the technology, almost as if they sense the truth deep down and want to maintain the suspension of disbelief. Those who do ask I give an honest answer to, but my heart sinks each time I see in their eyes that, much like militant atheists of yore, I've just taken their beliefs, crushed them beneath my feet, and offered nothing in return.

But I do have hope in the future; it's just that it's more complex to express than yelling vague statements like “to the moon; let's gooo!”. I do believe that someday there will be more fair distribution of wealth and that, ideally, getting obscenely rich from the hard labor of others should be considered shameful instead of the fucked up system we have today where being poor is stigmatized and acts as a prison at the same time. I believe that with therapy, education, and other support resources we can heal toxic masculinity in men, breaking the vicious cycle of status-seeking behavior. I wish that more people in 4chan meme-ridden chatroom knew that most of us feel like “degenerates” sometimes, but that it's possible to sit with that feeling and analyze where it's coming from instead of acting out and burning the entire planet down for the lulz.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don&#39;t care if these tokens are scams or if they actually reach the moon, it&#39;s the people who dream of society collapsing so their new money holds value is what worries me most.</p>&mdash; Kelsey Hightower (@kelseyhightower) <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1450945108438773760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2021</a></blockquote>

I hope that social status will one day be gained by giving kindness, not by getting property, and I know that we can get there, but only if we involve _everyone_, make progress incrementally, ensure a smooth and safe migration path away from the old institutions we aim to abandon, and ignore snake oil salesemen along the way.
